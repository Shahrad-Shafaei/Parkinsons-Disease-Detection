### Using Machine Learning to Analyze Voice Disorders for Parkinson's Disease Detection
Developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in an individual based on their voice recordings. 
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, with symptoms that include tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with coordination.
